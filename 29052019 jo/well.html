      I went down to the river,
      I set down on the bank.
      I tried to think but couldn't,
      So I jumped in and sank.

      I came up once and hollered!
      I came up twice and cried!
      If that water hadn't a-been so cold
      I might've sunk and died.

      But it was Cold in that water! It was cold!

      I took the elevator
      Sixteen floors above the ground.
      I thought about my baby
      And thought I would jump down.

      I stood there and I hollered!
      I stood there and I cried!
      If it hadn't a-been so high
      I might've jumped and died.

      But it was High up there! It was high!

      So since I'm still here livin',
      I guess I will live on.
      I could've died for love--
      But for livin' I was born

      Though you may hear me holler,
      And you may see me cry--
      I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
      If you gonna see me die.

      Life is fine! Fine as wine! Life is fine!

      News o' grief had overteaken
      Dark-eyed Fanny, now vorseaken;
      There she zot, wi' breast a-heaven,
      While vrom zide to zide, wi' grieven,
      Vell her head, wi' tears a-creepen
      Down her cheaks, in bitter weepen.
      There wer still the ribbon-bow
      She tied avore her hour ov woe,
      An' there wer still the hans that tied it
      Hangen white,
      Or wringen tight,
      In ceare that drowned all ceare bezide it.

      When a man, wi' heartless slighten,
      Mid become a maiden's blighten,
      He mid cearelessly vorseake her,
      But must answer to her Meaker;
      He mid slight, wi' selfish blindness,
      All her deeds o' loven-kindness,
      God wull waigh 'em wi' the slighten
      That mid be her love's requiten;
      He do look on each deceiver,
      He do know
      What weight o' woe
      Do break the heart ov ev'ry griever.
